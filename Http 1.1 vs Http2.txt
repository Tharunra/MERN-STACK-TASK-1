HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.1 HTTP1.1 loads a single request for every TCP 
connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.

HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is 
less network delay, then the page loads faster

HTTP 1.1 : 
     It supports connection reuse i.e. for every TCP connection there could
be multiple requests and responses, and pipelining where the client can request
several resources from the server at once. However , pipelining was hard to 
implement due to issues such as head-of-line blocking and was not a feasible solution.
HTTP 2 :
     Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be 
delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time. 
It is done using streams which can be prioritized, can have dependencies and 
individual flow control. It also provides a feature called server push that 
allows the server to send data that the client will need but has not yet requested.
